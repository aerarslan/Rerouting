Unity oyun motoru versiyon 2019.3.15f1

The simulation is built with Unity and the map is built on AirSim Windridge City Asset \cite{windridgecity} which is populated with vehicles that simulate movements of vehicles in traffic congestion and a drone that has a camera to take aerial images. \cite{niemirepo2019open} The simulation provides an average of 60 fps with an Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-10750H 12 core CPU on an RTX 2070S graphics card.

The simulation has objects such as traffic signs, overpasses, trees, flowerpots, traffic signs, road lights, traffic lights, roadside garbage, fire extinguishers, benches, barriers, and cafe umbrellas in traffic in a real city while taking a bird's-eye view.

The vehicle used in the simulation environment is the Audi Q8 2019, which has a length of 4.99 meters, a width of 2 meters and a height of 1.7 meters, and is available in 7 different colors. While the height of the drone may vary, it is 50 meters above the road during the tests and sees an area of 96 meters x 54 meters from the bird's eye view. The camera shots were made to obtain 1920x1080p images and the images were converted into real-life measurements in line with this resolution. Vehicles in the simulation can travel between 0 km / h and 50 km / h.

The objects in the simulation are used in a way that is compatible with real life. During the bird's eye view, realism is provided by using traffic lights, traffic lights, overpasses, and traffic signs to cover the road.
